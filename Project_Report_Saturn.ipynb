    "Here is a link to our data. The data set is entitled “Diabetes 130-US hospitals for years 1999-2008 dataset”, and comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The data was collected between 1999 and 2008 at 130 US hospitals and contains over 10,000 entries each corresponding to a patient with diabetes (type 1 or 2). Data was included in the dataset if it satisfied the following criteria: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. An inpatient encounter\n",
    "2. A diabetic encounter (i.e., where the patient was listed as having diabetes)\n",
    "3. The length of the patient’s hospital stay was between 1 and 14 days\n",
    "4. Laboratory tests were administered during the patient’s hospital stay\n",
    "5. The patient received medications during their hospital stay\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 55 attributes containing information about the patients demographics (age, gender, race, etc), medical history (inpatient and outpatient visits, medications, etc), hospital stay (medications, procedures, diagnosis, etc), and if they were readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of their initial hospital visit. The data set is complete; there are few missing values making the vast majority of the attributes usable for our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose this dataset because it contains our variable of interest: whether the patient was readmitted or not, along with ~46 potential predictors to use to fit the model. The dataset is extremely robust and comprehensive; it pools 10,000+ patients in the US across a decade. Having such broad and comprehensive data will help us generalize our findings. The number of predictors allows us to approach the problem from multiple perspectives: the patient’s characteristics, their hospital stay and medical history, and the treatments administered to them. \n"

    "We identified three groups of key stakeholders: (1) diabetes patients and their loved ones; (2) hospital staff involved in direct patient care; and (3) hospital administrators and those who have an interest in reducing the financial waste in healthcare (Medicaid).\n",
    "\n",
    "For diabetes patients and their loved ones, the results of this project will provide insight into factors impacting the diabetic’s continued risk of illness and subsequent hospital readmission. Even one stay in the hospital can be an emotional and financial burden on the patient and their family. Hospital readmissions exacerbate this toll on patients, not to mention that readmission is also associated with worse patient outcomes [3]. Thus, understanding which factors contribute to hospital readmission can empower patients and their family to take an active role toward improving their health outcomes. For instance, if a patient was aware that they had certain risk factors associated with greater likelihood of readmission, they could direct more time and resources towards these factors and away from other areas that may have less impact on hospital readmission. Patients and their family could be more vigilant toward early warning-signs and communicate proactively with their physician or healthcare provider about prevention. Overall, this knowledge can empower patients with diabetes to direct their efforts towards areas that most affect their health outcome. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hospital staff and physicians are another primary stakeholder group in this project. These individuals are directly charged with overseeing the healthcare plans of diabetic patients, and are morally, professionally, and financially invested in giving their patients the best possible care to improve health outcomes. With a better understanding of factors that impact the likelihood of a diabetic patient’s readmission, healthcare workers may be able to adjust their administration of care during the patient’s initial hospital visit. If a patient is at elevated risk of being readmitted, hospital staff can adjust their healthcare plan accordingly by focusing on reducing those factors that are most indicative of increased likelihood of readmission. This project may inform healthcare workers about which patients require the most vigilant and preventative intervention, potentially lowering both the morbidity and mortality for diabetics in their care.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, a third stakeholder group consists of hospital administrators and those with an interest in reducing the cost of healthcare. Hospital readmissions are financially costly to the healthcare system. The Affordable Care Act incentivizes the reduction of hospital admissions through financial penalties, reducing payments to hospitals with excessive readmissions. In 2021, the penalties are projected to cost hospitals $521 million dollars [4]. As such, hospital administrators may have a vested financial interest in identifying factors that most contribute to an increased likelihood of returning to the hospital.\n"
