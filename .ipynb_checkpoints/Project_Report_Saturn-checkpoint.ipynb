    "In our project, we used a dataset entitled “Diabetes 130-US hospitals for years 1999-2008 dataset” from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset can be accessed [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Diabetes+130-US+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008#). \n",
    "\n",
    "All data was collected between 1999 and 2008 from over 130 US hospitals and related care centers. The dataset contains over 10,000 entries, each corresponding to a patient with either Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Observations had to satisfy the following criteria to be included in this dataset: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The patient must have had an inpatient encounter (i.e., they must have been admitted to the hospital)\n",
    "2. The incident must have been a diabetic encounter (i.e., the patient had to have been a diabetic)\n",
    "3. The length of the patient’s hospital stay had to have been between 1 and 14 days\n",
    "4. Laboratory tests had to have been administered during the patient’s initial hospital stay\n",
    "5. The patient must have received medications during their hospital stay\n",
    "\n",
    "In the resulting dataset, there are 55 attributes with information about a patients demographics (such as their age, gender, and race); the patient's medical history (such as their number of inpatient and outpatient visits, medications, etc.); their initial hospital stay hospital stay (such as their number of medications, procedures, or diagnoses); and if the patient was readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of their initial hospital visit. The dataset is complete, though there are 8 attributes with missing values that encompass over 50% of the observations. The 47 additional attributes in the dataset have little-to-no missing values. Thus, the vast majority of the attributes in this dataset are usable as potential predictors for our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose to use this dataset because it contains our variable of interest (whether a patient was readmitted or not) along with ~46 potential predictors to use to fit the model. This dataset is extremely robust and comprehensive, including information on over 10,000 patients in the US across a decade. This broad and comprehensive data increases the generalizability of our study's findings. Its number of predictors also allows us to approach our problem from multiple perspectives: (1) the patient’s characteristics, (2) their hospital stay and medical history, and (3) the treatments administered to them.

    "We have identified three stakeholder groups that would benefit from our analysis: (1) diabetes patients and their loved ones; (2) hospital staff involved in direct patient care and; (3) hospital administraotrs and those who have an interest in reducing the financial waste in healthcare (i.e. Medicaid).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Diabetic Patients and Their Loved Ones \n",
    "Our first stakeholder group is diabetes patients and their loved ones. For diabetes patients and their loved ones, the results of our project could provide them insight into factors impacting the diabetic’s continued risks of illness and subsequent hospital readmissions. A  hospital stay can be emotionally and financially stressful for a diabetic patient and their family. Hospital readmissions then exacerbate this toll on patients by subjecting them to more inpatient stays. Further, as readmissions are associated with worse patient health outcomes, it is likely that diabetic who are readmitted will thus be readmitted again, worsening the burden to both their health and finances [3]. Understanding what factors contribute to hospital readmissions may empower patients and their families to take a more active and focused role in improving their health outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if a patient was aware that they had certain risk factors associated with a greater likelihood of readmission, they may direct more time and resources towards alleviating these factors and advocating for their health. Patients and their family could be more vigilant toward early warning-signs and communicate proactively with their physician or healthcare provider about prevention. Overall, this knowledge can empower patients with diabetes to direct their efforts towards areas that most affect their health outcome. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Hospital Staff Involved in Direct Patient Care \n",
    "Our second stakeholder group include hospital staff and physicians involved in direct patient care. These stakeholders are directly charged with overseeing the healthcare plans of diabetic patients. Thus, they are morally, professionally, and financially invested in giving their patients the best possible care to improve their health outcomes. With a better understanding of factors that impact the likelihood of a diabetic patient’s readmission, healthcare workers may adjust their administration of care during the patient’s initial hospital visit. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if a patient has an elevated risk of being readmitted, their doctor may  adjust the patient's healthcare plan to focus on and alleviate that risk. The patient thus will likely have better health outcomes, and their risk of returning to the hospital within 30 days of being released (the criteria for a readmission) would be avoided.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project may thus inform healthcare workers about which of their patients require the most vigilant and preventative interventions. Physicians, equipped with this knowledge, may then help to lower both the morbidity and mortality for diabetics in their care.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hospital Administrators and Medicaid\n",
    "Our third and final stakeholder group consists of hospital administrators and those with an active interest in reducing the cost of healthcare, like Medicaid providers. Hospital readmissions are financially costly to the healthcare system. The Affordable Care Act incentivizes the reduction of hospital admissions by financially penalizing hospitals with high readmission rates [4]. Penalties may include reduced payments to hospitals with excessive readmissions. In 2021, these penalties are projected to cost hospitals $521 million dollars [4]. As such, hospital administrators may have a vested financial interest in identifying factors that most contribute to an increased likelihood of returning to the hospital. By identifying such factors, administrators can allocate hospital resources towards addressing them, so that patient health outcomes are improved, readmissions decrease, and their hospital avoids suffering related financial penalties. \n"
